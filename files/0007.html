<h2><a href="#last" onclick="toggle('internal')">Internal forces at joints</a></h2>
    <ul id="internal" style="display:none"><!internal>

In a frame or a truss, members are separated by joints, also called articulation points. At these points, rotation
is not forbidden or resisted, so no internal moments will appear. However, these joints resist motion along both
spatial directions, so internal forces will appear if we separate two members. Let's see a case:<br><br>

<a  href="files/figures/78.png" target=_blank><img src="files/figures/78.png" width=400></a><br><br>

We see that there are three joints in this structure: C, D and F. This means we must break the structure at all
these points and analyze the internal forces that will appear in all of them.<br><br>

In order to do this, we need to draw the complete system <b>and</b> all the members separately.<br><br>

<a  href="files/figures/79.png" target=_blank><img src="files/figures/79.png" width=400></a><br><br>

This makes a total of 4 different rigid bodies. <i>Each rigid body must be depicted with all their forces
in a free body diagram.</i>

<a  href="files/figures/80.png" target=_blank><img src="files/figures/80.png" width=400></a><br><br>

Notice how in green we depict the forces we already know. In red, the reactions that we don't know and
in violet the internal forces at the joing, which we don't know either. These are the four free body
diagrams that you need to make in each problem. However, there are more things to be learned before
we can solve full problems. <br><br>

The first thing to notice here is that the articulation points (or joints) split into two versions
each. C becomes C and C'. D becomes D and D'. F becomes F and F'. However, at each internal point, 
the sum of all forces (internal plus external) must be zero. This implies that once you know, for example,
\(F_x\) then you automatically know \(F_x'\). Or, if during your strategy you arrive at \(F_y'\), then
the next step in the strategy is to automatically know \(F_y\). If no external forces act at this
joint, then, as \(F_y+F_y'=0\) we get \(F_y=-F_y'\) and you just simply change sign. However, be careful
if at this joint acts an external force, like in the example. Then, the sum of forces for y at the point
F is \(F_y+F_y'+2=0\) and then the rule \(F_y'=-F_y\) does not apply.<br><br>

Another thing to notice is that the vertical external force of 2N, suffered at F, is located at a joint.
Then, when we separate the members, we have the dilemma of whether we should place this force at only
one member (and in this case, which one) or whether we should put it in both members. The answer is that
you can place it at the member you want, the result must be the same. Or, if you like, you could put
1N at each member, or 0.5N at one and 1.5 at the other. The important thing is that when you rejoin
the members and evaluate all the forces suffered by the internal point, the external force adds to 2N
again.<br><br>

Notice as well that for all the unknowns we have followed choice 1 and we have placed all the hypotheses
as positive. If you prefer to use choice 2 you can do it, of course. In fact, your intuition may tell
you that if \((C_x,Cy)\) are positive in C, then you should draw \((C_x',C_y')\) negative at C' in order
to have zero-net internal force there. In fact, both approaches are correct! <br><br>

We arrive at one of the most important things to learn in this chapter. In the last chapter we learned to
distinguish between two-force members and multi-force members. Here we already know that only member CD
is two-force, while the others are multi-force. The important thing to know is that <b>two-force</b>
members suffer their total forces at each point aligned with the direction of the member, in either
traction or compression. Visually, the only three things that can happen for CD are:<br><br>

<a  href="files/figures/81.png" target=_blank><img src="files/figures/81.png" width=400></a><br><br>

In other words, the internal points C and D have only one unknown each, not two. It is true that these
forces are tilted and should be decomposed into two components, but once we arrive at one of them in
the strategy, we automatically know the other by trigonometry.<br><br>

This is why is so important to identify the two-force members, because then, when drawing the free body
diagrams, we will not place an incorrect list of unknowns. This means that our previous free body
diagrams were wrong, so now we correct them:<br><br>

<a  href="files/figures/82.png" target=_blank><img src="files/figures/82.png" width=400></a><br><br>

We see how the angle \(\alpha\) must be known from the start. Then, the two force member CD suffers
forces that point in the direction of the CD member! In the picture we have depicted the tilted
vectors \(\vec{C}, \vec{C}',\vec{D},\vec{D}'\) but all of them have the same slope. It is desirable
that you, in fact, decompose each of them into x and y components, but without forgetting that they
only represent one unknown, not two:<br><br> 

<a  href="files/figures/83.png" target=_blank><img src="files/figures/83.png" width=400></a><br><br>

If we would have a two-force non-straight member, the same principle applies. The forces at the two points
would either make compression or traction. And the line of action would be common for the forces at the
two points. What is different here is that, as it is a non-straight member, the line of compression or traction
does not follow the body of the member, but instead the line connecting the two suffering points. In fact, the
more generic law is that two-force members experience only traction or compression (or null) along the
line given by the two suffering points. For straight, members, this line is the same as the line of the
member. Here we see an example for traction:<br><br>


<a  href="files/figures/84.png" target=_blank><img src="files/figures/84.png" width=400></a><br><br>

<h2><a href="#last" onclick="toggle('fullexample')">A full example</a></h2>
    <ul id="fullexample" style="display:none"><!fullexample>

We are going to solve the previous example, so let's detail each step of the method, which is almost the same
method of the previous example. <br><br>

<b>STEP 0:</b> Coordinate axes:<br><br>
<a  href="files/figures/69.png" target=_blank><img src="files/figures/69.png" width=200></a><br><br>

<b>STEP 1:</b> Point labels, draw reactions and identify two force members:<br><br>

<a  href="files/figures/85.png" target=_blank><img src="files/figures/85.png" width=400></a><br><br>

The list of unknowns must wait for the next step. Notice there are two external forces, painted in green. The
reactions are painted in red. For internal forces we will use a third color: violet. We identify the
system as static. <br><br>

<b>STEP 2:</b> Free body diagram<b>s</b> and a list of unknowns:<br><br>

We have already done that before, but we repeat the figure here. Notice how important is the 
identification of two-force members.<br><br>


<a  href="files/figures/83.png" target=_blank><img src="files/figures/83.png" width=400></a><br><br>

The list of unknowns is:<br><br>

\(A_x\)<br>
\(A_y\)<br>
\(B_x\)<br>
\(C_x\)<br>
\(C_x'\)<br>
\(C_y\)<br>
\(C_y'\)<br>
\(D_x\)<br>
\(D_x'\)<br>
\(D_y\)<br>
\(D_y'\)<br>
\(F_x\)<br>
\(F_x'\)<br>
\(F_y\)<br>
\(F_y'\)<br><br>

There are 15 unknowns!<br><br>

<b>STEP 3:</b> Strategy table:<br><br>

Here you will see the importance of a good strategy table. Remember that every time you arrive to a new result,
you need to exploit this result all you can. For example, if you, for example, arrive to \(C_x'\), your immediate next
step must always be to get \(C_x\). <br><br>

Remember this well: if the system is static, <b>always do an strategy for external reactions first, and later continue
with internal forces</b>. This means that the full system diagram will be enough to solve the reactions. However,
<b>if the system is hyperstatic, you will need to have a mixed strategy for reactions and internal forces, involving
more than one free body diagram</b>. For now, we have an easy static case, but in your exam you will probably be
facing a hyperstatic one!<br><br>

Important note: when following a strategy, could you consider the diagram of more members combined, but
not being the full system? For example, taking AB and FE as one single member. The answer is yes. 
Sometimes this becomes very useful when thinking the strategy. Stay creative!<br><br>

<br><br>

Notice there are many different strategies that can be good. Just pic a good enough one!<br><br>
Check as well that the number of steps at the table matches the number of unknowns in the previous list.<br><br>

<br><br>

At step 8, be aware of the signs. In this case, member CD is pointing either NE (+,+) or SW (-,-), so
<i>the sign of both components must be the same</i>. If the CD member would have had the direction 
of SE (+,-) or NW(-,+), then the equation would have been \(C_y'=-C_x'\tan{45}\).<br><br>

<b>STEP 5:</b> Final diagram and checking:<br><br>

<a  href="files/figures/86.png" target=_blank><img src="files/figures/86.png" width=400></a><br><br>

Checking method:<br><br>

-Look at the full system diagram. Check that x forces sum to zero. The same for y forces. <br><br>

-Check each separate member. Check that x forces sum to zero and the same for y forces. <br><br>

-Check each joint. Check that all the <i><b>internal </b></i> forces suffered by the joint are zero.
If you sum all forces instead, including external ones, then the sum must give the external force value! (Spend some minutes trying to understand this point, which is crucial.)<br><br>
